## Docker Setup

Use this guide if you want to use Docker in your project.

### Getting Started

Update the environment variables in *docker-compose.yml*, and then build the images and spin up the containers:

```sh
$ docker-compose up -d --build

```
APP_SETTINGS="project.server.config.DevelopmentConfig"
```

Access the application at the address [http://localhost:5002/](http://localhost:5002/)

#### Testing

```sh
$ docker-compose run web python manage.py test
```

Test with coverage:

$ docker-compose run web python manage.py cov
```

Lint:

```sh
$ docker-compose run web flake8 project
```

## Run the app
